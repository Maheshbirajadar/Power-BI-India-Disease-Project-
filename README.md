# Indian_ Disease- Data Analysis (Interactive Dashboard created using Power BI)

# About Data Set:
Indian_ Disease data contains columns Patient ID, State, Age, Gender, Disease, Daily Routine, Work Type, Food Habit, Smoking/Drinking Habit and Physical Activity Level.

# Data Set:
The data was generated using a detailed prompt to ChatGPT, After Analyzing the Data, I felt the data was inconsistent because I observed People who do daily Activities, Non-Smoking and Eats good food are more Diseased. Then why I used this data set? Because I wanted to explore insights that challenge common assumptions. Instead of the usual belief that unhealthy habits cause more diseases, this dataset helps analyze hidden factors like genetics, work stress, environment, or undiagnosed conditions that might be influencing health outcomes.

#**Project Objective**

This dataset comes from a hospital and the Dashboard aims to analyze disease trends among patients based on demographics, lifestyle habits, and work types. This will help Hospitals identifying high-risk groups, improving preventive healthcare strategies, and optimizing resource allocation for better patient care and treatment outcomes.

# **Questions (KPIs)**
1) Total Diseased Population
2) Average Age of Patients
3) Percentage of Sedentary Lifestyle Patients
4) Work-Type Risk Factor

# **Analysis Questions:**

1) Which state has highest number of cases for each Disease?
2) What is the Average Age of People Diagnosed with each Disease?
3) Which work type is most associated with lifestyle disease?
4) How does food habit affect the occurrence of difference disease?
5) What is the percentage of smokers/drinkers in each disease category?
6) Which daily route is linked to the highest disease rate?
7) What is the distribution of gender across different disease?

# **Challenges Faced**
1) As the data source is ChatGPT, it was hard to imagine the outcome of data because the People who do daily Activities, Non-Smoking and Eats good food count was more.
2) The Age column data type was Text, So performed Trim which removed extra space the got changed to Whole Number.
3) Removed Duplicates (Performed on Patient ID)
4) Verifyed data consistency.
   
# **Tools & Techniques Used**
    Power BI features like DAX, Power Query, and visualizations.
    
# **Insights & Findings**
1) Disease Prevalence
> 910 total diseased individuals analyzed.
> Average age of diseased patients is 49 years.

2) Lifestyle & Disease Impact
> 51.65% of diseased individuals have a sedentary lifestyle, slightly higher than active ones (48.35%).
> 50.55% of diseased individuals do not smoke/drink, meaning lifestyle diseases may be influenced by other factors like diet and activity.

3) Food Habits & Disease Impact
> Fast food (32.97%) and Non-vegetarian diet (34.18%) show slightly higher disease prevalence compared to vegetarians (32.86%).
> Diet does not show a huge variation, meaning other factors may play a stronger role. 

4)  State-wise Disease Distribution
> West Bengal (114 cases), Uttar Pradesh (110 cases), and Bihar (97 cases) have the highest disease counts.
> States with lower cases (e.g., Gujarat - 72 cases) may indicate better health conditions or lower reporting.

5) Disease vs. Age Group
> Cancer (51.06 years), Tuberculosis (49.88 years), and Diabetes (49.77 years) show the highest average ages.
> Asthma has the lowest average age (45.15 years), meaning it affects relatively younger individuals.

# **Report Recommendation for Hospital Client:**

1) West Bengal (114), Uttar Pradesh (110), and Bihar (97) have the highest cases. Expanding operations and outreach in these states can improve healthcare access."
2) The Hospitals should Hire Doctors how are specialized in Diabetes, as Diabetes diseases are High.
3) Monitor Gender-Based Trends – Other and Male patients show slightly higher disease cases; specialized screenings can help.
4) High-Risk Food Habits – With 34.18% of cases linked to non-vegetarian diets and 32.97% to fast food, promote nutrition awareness.
5) Work-Type-Based Health Programs – Labor and unemployed individuals have higher disease prevalence, so tailor healthcare programs for them.
